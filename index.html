      <p>Enrolling in a full-stack web development bootcamp through UW has been one of the most enlightening experiences of my life, and I want to make sure the fundamentals of the course lead me furthur into the field.
        My background is in political organizing, especially in environmental activism and campaigning. I have a BA from The Evergreen State College in environmental policy, and while that has served me well organizing with nonprofits, I've come to learn that there is as much progress to be made engaging movements online as there is in face-to-face organizing.
      </p>

      <p>My first website made for the UW code bootcamp used D3.js data visualizing modules to display pollution data from the Census and Environmental Information Agency. I'm comfortable performing API calls, connecting to remote servers, displaying data in HTML and managing the data in JavaScript/Node.JS.</p>

      <p>Once the program is over I will be proficient using the MERN stack, and I look forward to applying these skills to whatever project that comes my way. My natural interests exist in environmentalism, and I will continue to make environmental progress using web platforms, and along the way my skills will be applied wherever they can be put to use.</p>
